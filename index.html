    CarbonOS is our brand new linux-based operating system that was made for buyers of our CarboTech computers. CarbonOS is aimed to make Linux a more easy and enjoyable experience.
   <br><br>
    Unlike other Linux Distrobutions, our operating system is sure to be suited to your liking with the use of our AI improvement and testing. With CarbonOS, you'll feel like you're using a computer that knows about you more than you do. We have integrated features such as automatic voice recognition, mouse-movement tracking, and log searching in order to make you feel at ease.

    We here at CarboTech sell computers and laptops by bringing dead/broken computers back to life and selling them for cheaper than the usual product you'd find in stores. We allow users to pick an operating system, either CarbonOS or Windows 10, and adjust the computer's hardware to that OS's liking. This allows you to have the most enjoyable experience with your favorite operating system, without having to worry about the hardware being incompatable. 
    <br>(Any Windows 10 computers support Windows 7 natively)
    <br>(Any CarbonOS computers support Ubuntu-based Linux distros natively)
    <br><br>
    You can buy our products listed below through Amazon or Ebay!
